# 1.20-pre5+ Loot Drops
Research, Simulation on 1.20-pre5+ Loot Drops. Also contains CUDA Kernels for finding cool loot drops.

The goal is just to simulate all the loot drops and, optionally, find seeds with cool loot drops (Records won't be here).

You should definitely watch this video by Matthew Bolan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5-dISWtkDs

Block's MD5 Values (Also leads to Entities and Gameplay) here: https://gist.github.com/xVoid879/996dad365721789e53855c59fcf2fd99

**Credits (In no particular order) for the research**
- [Tremeschin](https://github.com/tremeschin/) for exploring dead bush stick logic and how to obtain the two MD5 Values
- [Matthew Bolan](https://github.com/mjtb49/) on creating a video about loot drops. Also providing melon logic for 1.20-pre4.
- [Xpple](https://github.com/xpple/) providing gravel drop logic.
- (pseudogravity, ect adding more soon, gonna get all the code up in this repo first)
